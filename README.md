# Apple Browser Ban

I love freedom, innovation and progress. 

Today (year 2021) we are used to install native applications on our smartphones. But why? 

* Installing applications is annoying.
* Developing native applications is much more difficult than developing web based applications
* Developing a web frontend and a native app is useless/duplicated work.

Apple is restricting freedom, innovation and progress.

What I want:

* As I user a want to be able run the chromium browser engine on iPhone and IPad
* As I user I want my web-browser to have great offline functions like native apps have. See [What are Progressive Web Apps?](https://web.dev/what-are-pwas/)
* As a user I want my browser to by my new desktop. I want to create bookmarks and send hyperlinks from all pages.
* As a developer I want to write code once and I want users to be able to access my application by following a hyperlink. I want my users give access to my web application without requiring them to install a native app.
* As an enterpreneur I want to reduce development costs: I don't want to be "Waiting for Review" by the App Store owner. I want publish new version within minutes.

This is a small collection of links and notes about "Apple Browser Ban".

> By forcing browser vendors like Google, Microsoft and Mozilla to use the WebKit browser engine, Apple is deliberately restricting the functionality of web apps on iOS. It’s why many of the features of progressive web apps (PWAs) do not work on an iPhone or iPad.
